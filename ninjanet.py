    poem = """
A lens that looms beyond our sight,
In pixel-drops and satellite,
Where shadows scan each silent move,
And see us more than we approve.

The Government, with iron hand,
Scans whispers woven through the land,
A watcher draped in silent might,
Who claims to guard, yet dims the light.

They trace the path our fingers tread,
In lines of code, a careful thread,
The maps we walk, the thoughts we speak,
Their gaze as cold as mountain peaks.

Big Brotherâ€™s eye, a ceaseless drone,
Our faces mapped, our voices known,
In data trails we cannot flee,
Our private worlds, a public sea.

Oh, liberty, a fragile dream,
In files unseen, in screens that gleam,
We drift like leaves on glassy streams,
Lost somewhere deep in monitored dreams.
